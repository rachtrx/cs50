          <h4>Football</h4>
          <p>
            I have played Football since I was a child at 10 years old. I think my strength is dribbling and my weakness is stamina. Though I haven't played in a while because I am working and studying at the same time, I still follow football matches closely. My favourite Team is Real Madrid, and my favourite player is Cristiano Ronaldo.

          <h4>Tennis</h4>
          <p>
            I started playing tennis when I was 18 years old. However, I have followed it since I was a child. My favourite player is Rafael Nadal as he was the first player I knew. He seems very humble but I was pleasantly surprised to learn that he has links to Real Madrid!

          <h4>Badminton</h4>
          <p>
            I was in the Badminton CCA at 12 years old. I played it very regularly while I had to serve 2 years in the Army. My favourite player has to be Loh Kean Yew since he represents my country but I really like Viktor Axelsen as he is a beast and his playstyle is very entertaining.
