          <h4>Cubing</h4>
            <p>
              I enjoy cubing and have been doing so since 14 years old. I have always been strong in Mathematics as a child, so I loved algorithms, and memorised over 100 algorithms (though I have probably forgotten quite a few). I know how to solve cubes of all sizes and the Megaminx!

          <h4>Financial Markets</h4>
            <p>
              I was fascinated by financial markets when I was 18 years old. I want to be able to understand how financial markets are connected with each other, such as the various stock markets, bond markets, commodity markets, and currency markets!

          <h4>Finding the best tech</h4>
            <p>
              I love technology, and I am trying to learn as much as possible in the world of technology to understand more about how it works. I wish to become a quantitative developer one day! I have a certificate in Networking (Cisco CCNA), and in AWS (Cloud Certified Practitioner). After CS50, I want to start studying Quantitative Finance.
              Some devices that have greatly increased my productivity are the Galaxy SmartTag, the UGREEN 200W charger, my Sony WF-1000XM4 earphones, a Legion 5 Laptop, a Surface Pro. and Fast-Charging Portable Chargers. I am looking to buy a Google Nest Router for my University!
