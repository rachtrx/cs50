The person's top 100 songs had an average of 0.65906 for energy, 0.71646 for danceability and 0.484443 for valence.
It has high danceability and low valence.

This might not be he best representation because the person may have listened to a lot more than 100 songs, which causes this sample to be inaccurate. To get a better estimate, we could increase the sample size for number of songs (eg. calculate based on the person's top 500 songs.)
